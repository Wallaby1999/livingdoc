== Motivation
Documentation is hard. Every programmer knows this. It's also boring and repetitive, and the result often looks ugly
and is hard to read (because not all programmers are poets). The fact that written documentation is usually outdated
before it has been finished doesn't make it any better.
                                                        
Therefore, writing documentation it is usually something programmers try to avoid.

There is a simple truth you will often hear when talking to programmers about documentation: the most accurate
documentation is the code itself. It's the only thing that won't become outdated, won't lie to you, and will always be
complete.

But code is difficult to understand. If you have ever tried to learn about a code base without written documentation,
you'll know that it is very, very hard to glean anything useful from it.

=== Living Diagrams

==== History
The idea to generate UML diagrams from source code isn't new. Actually, it has a long history in software development,
a history that is often quite disappointing. Many tools provide reverse engineering capabilities, for example:

* UML tool suites
* IDEs
* Dedicated generators

===== UML tool suites

There are tools like Together, Rational Rose, Enterprise Architect etc. They often do a decent job generating UML
diagrams and sometimes even provide full Roundtrip-Engineering capabilities. However, they are usually extremely
expensive, have a high learning curve and force the development team to fully buy into their proprietary way of working.
In addition, the resulting diagrams are difficult to integrate into the actual documentation written outside of the tool
itself, so often users will find themselves resorting to pasting image files that are - again - difficult to keep
up-to-date.

===== IDEs

IDEs like Netbeans, Eclipse or IntelliJ play somewhat in the same league. Their reverse engineering capabilities are
usually less thorough, but also come at a cheaper price. Sadly, though, the IDEs' UML modules share most of the other
negative aspects of their expensive brethren. For example, here is a diagram as IntelliJ IDEA would render it:

.Test classes hierarchy generated using IntelliJ IDEA
image::idea-package-example.png[Package diagram rendered by IntelliJ IDEA, float=left]

While this is a clean and nicely drawn UML diagram, the developer has not much influence on how it looks. For example,
it cannot show field associations, and neither is there a possibility to include notes or comments to explain things.
It is also impossible to exclude unwanted parts from the diagram or make references to types outside the package.

'''

===== Dedicated generators
Quite contrary to the previously mentioned reverse engineering tools, dedicated UML diagram generators are usually cheap
or even free of charge, for example the https://www.spinellis.gr/umlgraph/javadoc/index.html[UMLGraph JavaDoc doclet].
Since they can usually be made part of automated toolchains, it is often a lot easier to integrate their products into
the parts of the documentation that live in close proximity to the code, for example JavaDocs. Despite these positive
aspects, it's usually still very difficult to influence what the diagrams display, and how.

==== A new concept: Living Documentation
'Living Documentation' is a term coined by Gojko Adzik in his book https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/?src=/resources.html[Specification by example].
His work (that is mostly about BDD - Behavior Driven Development) gave inspiration to the work of Cyrille Martraire, a
french software engineer who tries to take the approach to a new level in his book https://leanpub.com/livingdocumentation[Living Documentation].
The core principles of Living Documentation are:

* It is *reliable* - all documentation products are always accurate and in sync with the actual code
* Producing and updating it is *low effort*
* It is both a product and a medium of *collaboration* between all involved people
* It is *insightful* for its consumers and sheds light on the important aspects of the system

One of the crucial insights taken from Cyrille's book is that it *is* possible to produce a lot of helpful documentation
artifacts by traversing the code using automated generators. One of the key difference to most existing tools that
generate documentation (including diagrams) from code is that the tool chain is written in such a way that it permits
the development team to adapt and enhance what comes out of it, producing results that both have real value and are
still as close to the single source of truth (the code) as possible.

In this blog post, we build on this concept but concentrate on a subset of the ideas from Living Documentation:
**Living Diagrams**. We'd like to generate UML Diagrams, namely UML Class Diagrams, directly from the code. So, let us
intruce the PlantUML Class Diagram Generator.

== The PlantUML Class Diagram Generator

The PlantUML Class Diagram Generator is a tool that produces PlantUML Class diagrams from Java source code.

.What is PlantUML?
****
https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] is a tool that generates various types of UML diagrams from a written specification. It
has a simple but powerful language for describing UML diagrams, with further annotation and styling capabilities that
allow producing diagrams that are both useful and nice looking. Some of the supported diagram types are:

* Use Case
* Class
* Sequence
* Activity
* Component

****

The PlantUML Class Diagram Processor creates only class diagrams and can be used to document class hierarchies that
live in a specific package. Due to PlantUML's ability to import diagrams into other diagrams, it is also possible to
display whole package hierarchies in a songle diagram. However, thanks to its underlying concepts, these diagrams
can be tailored to show only classes that are relevant for specific use cases, so they won't overwhelm the reader with
superfluous or redundant information.

=== Design principles
The generator is designed around a limited set of principles derived from the ideas of Living Documentation:

[horizontal]
Relevance::
The programmer decides what elements from the sources should show up in generated diagrams, so they are always relevant
to the use case depicted
Proximity::
Diagram controls are an intrinsic part of the source code, so its unlikely they'll become outdated
Configurability::
Diagram Controls give the developer a lot of control over what is generated and may be annotated with additional
information, e.g. comments
Currentness::
Diagrams are re-generated with every build

=== Annotation library
At the moment, the annotation library contains following annotations for class diagrams:

link:annotations/src/main/java/com/comsysto/livingdoc/annotation/plantuml/PlantUmlClass.java[@PlantUmlClass]::
This is the main annotation to be used for class diagrams. When added to a Java type (interface, class or enum), a
representation of this type is included in one or more diagrams.
link:annotations/src/main/java/com/comsysto/livingdoc/annotation/plantuml/PlantUmlField.java[@PlantUmlField]::
This annotation may be added to a field within a type already annotated with **@PlantUmlClass**. It will render the
field as part of the class body and/or add an association to the field's type, provided that type is also part of the
diagram.
link:annotations/src/main/java/com/comsysto/livingdoc/annotation/plantuml/PlantUmlExecutable.java[@PlantUmlExecutable]::
Annotation for methods that should show up within a type already annotated with **@PlantUmlClass**. It will render the
method as part of the class body, provided that type is also part of the diagram.
link:annotations/src/main/java/com/comsysto/livingdoc/annotation/plantuml/PlantUmlNote.java[@PlantUmlNote]::
This annotation may be used to associate one or more UML notes with a type, providing further textual description.
link:annotations/src/main/java/com/comsysto/livingdoc/annotation/plantuml/PlantUmlDependency.java[@PlantUmlDependency]::
Can be used to draw additional dependency relations between types that are not directly connected via an
association.

=== Annotation processor
The annotation processor is a normal Java annotation processor that can be included easily as a Java compiler argument -
either using the programmer's favorite Java IDE's project configuration, or as part of the build process.
The annotation processor produces a model of the elements to be rendered in the resulting diagrams and then outputs the
PlantUML source code. The annotation processor can be configured using the following options (specified using the ``-A``
parameter of the Java compiler):

.PlantUML Class Diagram Processor options
|===
|Option |Default value

|**pumlgen.settings.dir** +
The directory where the annotation processor will search for a file ``${diagramId}_class.properties`` for additional
diagram settings
|``.`` (the current directory)

|**pumlgen.out.dir** +
The directory where the annotation processor will write diagram files
|``./out``

|**pumlgen.enabled** +                                             
This setting may be used to completely disable the processor at compilation time despite its presence on the classpath
|``true``
|===

=== Examples
The test sources contain an artificial class hierarchy that models different types of vehicles and is used as a (quite
simple) example. Please have a look at the diagram - it is auto-generated using the annotation processor:

==== Example 1: The whole test classes hierarchy

.Test classes hierarchy generated using the processor
ifdef::env-github[]
image::package_class.png[Annotation processor classes, float=right]
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
plantuml::annotation-processors/out/package_class.puml[imagesoutdir="./annotation-processors/doc"]
endif::[]

The first example displays the hierarchy of all annotated classes in the package. We find it notable how clean and
expressive this diagram is compared to diagrams rendered using conventional means:

* It shows all the associations between the classes that the annotation processor managed to discern from the Java type
model: inheritance (both realization and implementation) as well as field references
* It has a note. In our view, notes are often the single thing that converts a say-nothing diagram into something that
helps the reader understand the software fully
+
NOTE: We did not consider it useful to render the contents of JavaDoc comments in notes. First, comments use HTML markup
and PlantUML uses the Creole markup language. Second, a JavaDoc comment that fully describes a complex type can be very
large. It makes much more sense to write a brief (and possible redundant) description into the annotation itself.

==== Example 2: Selected classes only

.Grund vehicles
ifdef::env-github[]
image::ground-vehicles_class.png[Annotation processor classes, float=left]
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
plantuml::annotation-processors/out/ground-vehicles_class.puml[imagesoutdir="./annotation-processors/doc", float=left]
endif::[]

It is also possible to render multiple different diagrams from the same sources. This is controlled through the
``diagramIds`` attribute of the ``@PlantUmlClass`` annotation. This is a list of strings that define the diagrams where
the type will appear.

[horizontal]
DiagramId:: The diagram ID is the part of the filename that comes before the ``_class.puml``. The default diagram ID is
is therefore **package**. The ground vehicles diagram's ID is **ground-vehicles**.

'''

== Annotation processor internals

In this section, we will look at the internal structure of the annotation processor. To reach our goal to auto-generate
PlantUML class diagrams, we had to solve the following problems:

* Annotation definition
* How to implement an annotation processor
* How to produce the diagram

=== Annotation definition
This is actually the easiest part. We begin with the top-most annotation we want to process, the ``@PlantUmlClass``.
From there, we consider what diagram elements we want to display and what additional information is required to enrich
the resulting diagrams:

Type elements:: A type in the class diagram is created from a class, interface or enum in Java. All required information
about the type itself can be gleaned from the Java source code except for the following:

* We want to know in which diagrams the type will appear, so we introduce an attribute ``diagramIds``
* There should be a possibility to attach a note to the type. For this, an additional annotation is created, the
``@PlantUmlNote``, with an attribute ``body`` that defines the text body (optionally with
link:http://plantuml.com/creole[Creole] markup), and an attribute ``position`` that permits to position the note in
relation to the element it's attached to.

Fields and methods:: As with types, we do not want to indiscriminately include all fields and methods in the class
diagram. So we need at least one other annotation to mark fields and methods to be displayed.
Considering that there may be more (and quite different) information we need to provide depending on the type of
element, we decided to actually have two separate annotations ``PlantUmlField`` for fields and ``PlantUmlExecutable``
for methods and constructors.

Dependency Relations:: Finally, we want to be able to define relations between classes that are not visible in the
source code (through fields). In UML, these are called dependency relations and depicted using a dashed line between
elements. So there is another annotation ``@PlantUmlDependency`` with an optional ``description``.

.How to create an annotation in Java
****
Defining a Java annotation is clearly documented and the knowledge how to do this should be a part of every Java
programmer's toolbox:

[source,java]
----
@Target({ ElementType.TYPE }) // <2>
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE) // <3>
public @interface PlantUmlClass { // <1>

    String[] diagramIds() default { "package" }; // <4>
}
----
<1> An annotation is a special form of interface, identified by the keyword ``@interface``
<2> For every annotation, a list of possible __targets__ needs to be specified identifying the elements where the
annotation is allowed to appear (e.g. type, field, method, ...)
<3> Also for every annotation, the programmer should specify the __retention policy__. This tells the compiler what to do
with the annotation after processing it. Most Java programmers choose ``RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME`` quite automatically
because (1) its the retention policy used in most examples and (2) because a lot of annotations are processed at runtime
using reflection. However, the annotations of the PlantUML class diagram processor will be required neither by the
compiler nor at runtime, so we discard them after the processing phase (``RetentionPolicy.SOURCE``)
****

=== How to implement an annotation processor

All Java programmers know how to use annotations, and most of the more senior ones know how to write and process them -
at runtime. To process annotations at compile time, however, requires some additional steps:

* Implement the Processor interface
* Make the processor known to the Java compiler
* Implement logic based on the Java (annotation processing) language model

==== Implement the processor interface

[source,java]
----
@SupportedAnnotationTypes("com.comsysto.livingdoc.annotation.plantuml.PlantUmlClass")  // <3>
@SupportedOptions({KEY_SETTINGS_DIR, KEY_OUT_DIR, KEY_ENABLED})  // <4>
@SupportedSourceVersion(SourceVersion.RELEASE_8)  // <5>
public class PlantUmlClassDiagramProcessor extends AbstractProcessor { // <1>
    @Override
    public boolean process(final Set<? extends TypeElement> annotations, final RoundEnvironment roundEnv) {
        // ... <2>
    }

    // ...
}
----
<1> All annotation processors must implement the interface
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html[Processor] or its descendant
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/AbstractProcessor.html[AbstractProcessor]
<2> Annotation processors need to define the annotations they process. This list doesn't have to include __all__
annotations used by the processor, however! Only the top-level annotations that should be delivered by the processing
framework when it calls the ``process(..)`` method are required here - in our case, that's only the annotation
``@PlantUmlType``
<3> Processors need to define the options they proccess - those put on the ``javac`` command line using the ``-A``
parameter
<4> Processors need to define the Java source version they understand
<5> The current version of the processor has been tested with Java 8

==== Add the required meta information
In addition to the implementation processor, we have to add the following file:

.META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor
[source]
----
com.comsysto.livingdoc.annotation.processors.plantuml.PlantUmlClassDiagramProcessor
----

This file, containing only the fully qualified class name of the processor, causes it to be registered with the
annotation processing environment.

TIP: Alternatively, https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/service:[Google Autoservice] may be used to autogenerate this file.

=== Data Model

Our little project would look quite bad if we weren't 'eating our own dog food'. So the centerpiece of our documentation
for the PlantUML Class Diagram generator is a class diagram, fully auto-generated from annotations:

ifdef::env-github[]
image::annotation-processor_class.png[Annotation processor classes]
endif::[]                     
ifndef::env-github[]
plantuml::annotation-processors/out/annotation-processor_class.puml[]
endif::[]

== What's next?
The first version of something is seldom perfect. There is a lot more that could be done:

* Support for additional class diagram elements
* Support for other diagram types

=== Support for additional class diagram elements

While the feature set supported by the annotation processor is enough
to use it in a productive way, the limits of what may be rendered into the resulting class diagrams are still obvious.
For example, there is no support yet for:

* Methods
* Relation notes
* Special associations like aggregation and composition
* Floating notes
* Generics
* Stereotypes
* ...

=== Support for other diagram types

For us, generating class diagrams is only a first step. Going further, we'd like to investigate rendering other diagram
types. The class diagram was the obvious place to start, since its features closely match the information that can be
gleaned from the information harvested by the annotation processing environment.

== Conclusion
In this blog post, we have shown that it is well possible to generate useful diagrams from source code by giving the
developers a big deal of influence on the outcome using Java annotations, along with a tool set that, while still being
in an early stage of development, can already produce very nice and fully accurate class diagrams. We hope that this
blog post will be the first in a series in which we will try to extend its capabilities into a complete tool suite that
helps developers in writing documentation that is accurate, close to the code, and always up to date.
